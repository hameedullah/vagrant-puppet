    # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.

    # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
    # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
    # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.

    # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
    # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
    # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
    # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

    # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
    # using a specific IP.
    # We start from .11, just in case
    master.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.101.11"

    # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
    # your network.

    # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
    # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.

    master.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    #   vb.gui = true
    #
    #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
	vb.memory = "4096"
    end
    #
    # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
    # information on available options.


    # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
    # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
    # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
    # argument is a set of non-required options.
    # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"


    # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
    # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at

    # config.push.define "atlas" do |push|

    # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
    # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
